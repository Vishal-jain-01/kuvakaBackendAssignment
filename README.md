# Lead Scoring Backend API

AI-powered lead scoring system that combines rule-based logic with Google Gemini AI reasoning to qualify prospects and determine their buying intent.

## üöÄ Live Demo

**API Base URL:** `http://localhost:3000` (replace with deployed URL)  
**Health Check:** `http://localhost:3000/health`

## üìã Overview

This backend service accepts product/offer information and a CSV of leads, then scores each lead's buying intent (High/Medium/Low) using:

1. **Rule-based scoring (max 50 points):**
   - Ro**4. Scoring returns low scores**
- Verify offer data matches industry keywords
- Check that lead roles contain decision-maker keywords
- Ensure Gemini API key is configured for better AI scoring

**5. Gemini API errors**
- Verify API key is valid and active
- Check network connectivity
- System will fall back to heuristic scoring automaticallynce: Decision maker (+20), Influencer (+10), Others (0)
   - Industry match: Exact ICP (+20), Adjacent (+10), No match (0)
   - Data completeness: All fields present (+10)

2. **AI-powered scoring (max 50 points):**
   - Google Gemini AI analysis of prospect + offer context
   - Intent classification: High (50pts), Medium (30pts), Low (10pts)
   - Contextual reasoning for each classification

**Final Score = Rule Score + AI Score (max 100)**

## üßÆ Scoring Logic Explained

### Rule-Based Scoring (Max 50 points)

#### Role Relevance (Max 20 points)
- **Decision Makers (+20):** CEO, CTO, CFO, COO, President, Founder, Owner, Director, VP, Head of, Manager
- **Influencers (+10):** Senior, Principal, Architect, Specialist, Analyst, Coordinator, Supervisor, Team Lead
- **Others (0):** All other roles

#### Industry Match (Max 20 points)
- **Exact ICP Match (+20):** SaaS, Software, Technology, Tech, Fintech, EdTech, B2B, Enterprise Software, Cloud, Digital, Platform, API
- **Adjacent Industries (+10):** Finance, Consulting, Marketing, E-commerce, Healthcare, Education, Real Estate, Manufacturing
- **No Match (0):** All other industries

#### Data Completeness (Max 10 points)
- **All 6 fields present (+10):** name, role, company, industry, location, linkedin_bio
- **Partial credit:** Proportional points for missing fields

### AI-Powered Scoring (Max 50 points)

The AI analyzes prospect profile + product context to classify intent:

- **High Intent (50 points):** Strong role authority + perfect industry fit + clear need indicators
- **Medium Intent (30 points):** Some positive indicators but not all criteria met
- **Low Intent (10 points):** Limited indicators of buying intent or decision-making authority

**AI Prompt Template:**
```
Product/Offer: [name]
Value Props: [value_props]
Ideal Use Cases: [ideal_use_cases]

Prospect Profile:
- Name: [name]
- Role: [role]
- Company: [company]
- Industry: [industry]
- Location: [location]
- LinkedIn Bio: [linkedin_bio]

Based on the prospect's profile and the product offering, classify their buying intent as High, Medium, or Low.

Consider:
- Role authority and decision-making power
- Industry fit with the product
- Company stage and likely needs
- Geographic relevance
- Profile completeness and engagement indicators

Respond in this exact format:
Intent: [High/Medium/Low]
Reasoning: [1-2 sentences explaining your classification]
```

## üß™ Testing the API

### Using curl

Test the complete workflow:

```bash
# 1. Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# 2. Upload offer
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/offer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"AI Sales Tool","value_props":["Automated outreach","Higher conversion"],"ideal_use_cases":["B2B SaaS"]}'

# 3. Upload leads (use the provided sample_leads.csv)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/leads/upload \
  -F "file=@sample_leads.csv"

# 4. Run scoring
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/score

# 5. Get results
curl http://localhost:3000/api/results

# 6. Export CSV
curl -O -J http://localhost:3000/api/results/export
```

### Using Postman

Import this collection JSON or manually create requests:

1. **POST** `{{baseUrl}}/api/offer` with JSON body
2. **POST** `{{baseUrl}}/api/leads/upload` with form-data file upload
3. **POST** `{{baseUrl}}/api/score` (no body)
4. **GET** `{{baseUrl}}/api/results`
5. **GET** `{{baseUrl}}/api/results/export`

Set `baseUrl` variable to `http://localhost:3000` (or your deployed URL).

```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **In-Memory Storage:** Using Map-based storage for simplicity. In production, replace with PostgreSQL/MongoDB.

2. **Modular Scoring:** Separate rule engine and AI scorer for maintainability and testing.

3. **Graceful Fallback:** When Gemini API is unavailable, falls back to heuristic-based scoring.

4. **Comprehensive Validation:** Input validation on all endpoints with detailed error messages.

5. **Rate Limiting:** Built-in protection against API abuse.

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `NODE_ENV` | Runtime environment | `development` | No |
| `PORT` | Server port | `3000` | No |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini API key for AI scoring | - | Recommended |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | CORS allowed origins | `*` | No |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` | Rate limit window | `900000` (15min) | No |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` | Max requests per window | `100` | No |

### Gemini AI Setup

1. Get API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Add to `.env` file: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here`
3. The system uses `gemini-pro` model for advanced reasoning

**Without Gemini key:** The system uses intelligent heuristic-based fallback scoring.

## üìä Response Formats

### Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": { ... }
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message",
  "details": [...],  // In development mode only
  "availableEndpoints": { ... }  // For 404 errors
}
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Quick Deploy Options

**Railway:**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway add
railway deploy
```

**Render:**
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Set build command: `npm install`
3. Set start command: `npm start`
4. Add environment variables in dashboard

**Vercel:**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### Production Considerations

1. **Database:** Replace in-memory storage with persistent database
2. **File Storage:** Use cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary) for file uploads
3. **Caching:** Add Redis for performance optimization
4. **Monitoring:** Add logging (Winston) and error tracking (Sentry)
5. **Security:** Add authentication, input sanitization, and request validation

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

Tests cover:
- Rule engine logic
- API endpoint responses  
- CSV parsing functionality
- Error handling scenarios

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Server won't start**
- Check if port 3000 is available
- Verify all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
- Check Node.js version (needs 16+)

**2. CSV upload fails**
- Ensure CSV has required headers: `name,role,company,industry,location,linkedin_bio`
- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Verify file encoding (UTF-8 recommended)

**3. Scoring returns low scores**
- Verify offer data matches industry keywords
- Check that lead roles contain decision-maker keywords
- Ensure OpenAI API key is configured for better AI scoring

**4. OpenAI API errors**
- Verify API key is valid and has credits
- Check network connectivity
- System will fall back to heuristic scoring automatically

## üìà Performance

- **Concurrent Processing:** Handles multiple leads efficiently
- **Memory Management:** Optimized for processing large CSV files
- **Rate Limiting:** Protects against API abuse
- **Caching:** In-memory storage for fast access during session

## üîí Security Features

- Helmet.js security headers
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting per IP
- Input validation and sanitization
- File type and size restrictions
- Error message sanitization in production
